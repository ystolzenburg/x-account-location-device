- Combined DOM selectors reduce query overhead in MutationObserver
- Cached combined selector at module level (avoids repeated string creation)
- Memoized function creation in content script initialization
- Removed keep-alive console spam in service worker

### 🧠 Memory & Stability
- New shared `lru-cache.js` module eliminates code duplication
- Fixed memory leak in UI cleanup function registry (bounded Map with 1000 max entries)

- ESLint auto-fix applied for consistent quote style
- Removed unused function parameters in constants.js

- Magic numbers moved to TIMING constants (rate limit cooldown, keep-alive interval, etc.)

### 🔧 Build System
- Version now auto-syncs from package.json to manifest.json and all JS bundles
- Added `@rollup/plugin-replace` for build-time constant injection
- Separate CHANGELOG.md with nice README integration
