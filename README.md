# X-Posed: Account Location & Device Info

**See where X users are from and what devices they use.**

A Browser Extension and Userscript that displays country flags 🇺🇸 and device icons 📱 next to every X (~~Twitter~~) username. Know who you're interacting with—their location and platform—at a glance. Bonus: optional geo-blocking to filter your feed by country.

## 📰 Background

This script leverages X's official "Country Labels" feature announced on November 16, 2025. X now displays account locations derived from signals like IP addresses, app store regions, and posting behavior. This feature helps identify authentic accounts and combat foreign interference, though it raises privacy concerns for users in repressive regions.

The script extracts this official location and device data from X's GraphQL API, presenting it in a user-friendly format with flags and device emojis.

## ✨ Features

### 🌍 Core Features: Location & Device Intelligence

- **Device Indicators**: Instantly see if users are on mobile 📱, desktop 💻, or web 🌐
- **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed info on hover (e.g., "Connected via: United States Android App")

- **Universal Coverage**: Works on timelines, profiles, replies, and search results
- **Country Filtering**: Block tweets from specific countries if desired

> [!NOTE]
> **Windows Support Added:** Windows 10/11 doesn't natively support flag emojis. This extension now automatically detects Windows and replaces the broken characters with high-quality Twemoji images (the same ones Twitter uses), so flags look perfect on all platforms! 🎨

### v1.1.0

## 🔧 How It Works

### API Integration
- Intercepts X's own API calls to capture authentication headers
- Queries X's GraphQL API for user profile data
- Extracts `account_based_in` (location) and `source` (device) fields
- Maps locations to country flag emojis
- Maps device info to platform emojis

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- Uses X's public GraphQL API
- Only queries public profile information
- Rate limited to ~50 requests per timeframe (automatically handled with queuing and caching)

### Privacy
- No data collection or transmission to third parties
- All API calls go directly to X's servers
- Data is cached locally in your browser only
